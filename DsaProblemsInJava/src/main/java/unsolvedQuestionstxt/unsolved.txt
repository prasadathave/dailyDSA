We are given a list of processes and a list of processors which are basically the integer lists , one processor can process one process at a time and it will take one second for the processor to process and for next second it won't be able to process any request , And a processor can only process a request which is having size smaller than or equal to that of processor , find what is the amount of time required to process all of the processes ?
