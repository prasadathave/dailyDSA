We are given a list of processes and a list of processors which are basically the integer lists , one processor can process one process at a time and it will take one second for the processor to process and for next second it won't be able to process any request , And a processor can only process a request which is having size smaller than or equal to that of processor , find what is the amount of time required to process all of the processes ?


Appeared in Amazon interview -
1. You are given a list and you have to remove an element and merge adjacent elements by summing and find such maximum sum till only one element is left in array.
Example - [1,-3,1] -> [1,1] -> [2] ---After one operation
If you remove elements at end then no need for merging
